## ⚡ Super Fast Method

### Use Browser Tabs:
1. Open all search links in separate tabs (Ctrl+Click)
2. In each tab: Click image → Download "Large" → Save with correct name
3. Move all downloaded files to correct folders at once

---

## 🎯 Download Settings

When downloading from Pexels:
- **Size**: "Large" or "Original" (don't use "Small")
- **Format**: Keep as JPG
- **Rename immediately** to match the exact file names above

---

## 📁 File Name Reference

**Thumbnails**: `thumbnail.jpg` (every project needs one)
**Gallery**: `gallery-1.jpg`, `gallery-2.jpg`, `gallery-3.jpg`, `gallery-4.jpg`

---

## ✅ After Downloading

1. Refresh browser: http://localhost:3000
2. Check homepage - hero and featured projects should show images
3. Go to /projects - all project cards should show thumbnails
4. Click any project - gallery should display

---

## 🆘 Quick Tips

- **Can't find perfect match?** Just pick something close - you can replace later
- **Wrong size?** Pexels allows multiple downloads of same image
- **Taking too long?** Start with just the hero image and 3 featured projects
- **Images not showing?** Make sure file names are EXACTLY as specified (lowercase, no spaces)

---

## 🔥 FASTEST POSSIBLE METHOD

**Use this search directly**:
https://www.pexels.com/search/interior%20design/

Filter by: **Landscape** orientation

**Then download first 29 good images** you see and distribute them:
- 1st image → hero/hero-main.jpg
- Next 4 → penthouse folder
- Next 3 → hotel-goa folder
- Next 4 → office-bangalore folder
- And so on...

This takes only 10-15 minutes but won't be as precisely matched to each project.
